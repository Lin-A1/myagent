# Frontend Technology Stack (Vue)

This section complements the Technology Stack and Coding Guidelines above and defines frontend standards for Vue-based projects.

- Framework: Vue 3 (Composition API), TypeScript, Vite
- State Management: Pinia (optional persisted state)
- Router: Vue Router (lazy loading and route-level code splitting)
- UI Library (choose one primary): Element Plus, Naive UI, Ant Design Vue, Vuetify
- Styling and Design System: Tailwind CSS, SCSS (optional), PostCSS, CSS Modules or scoped styles
- HTTP and Data: Axios (centralized instance and interceptors), `@tanstack/vue-query` (optional; request caching and retries)
- Forms and Validation: Library-provided form components plus Zod/Yup as appropriate
- Lint/Format: ESLint (`@typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-vue`), Prettier (or Biome, optional), Stylelint (optional)
- Testing: Vitest, Vue Test Utils; E2E: Playwright or Cypress
- Documentation and Demos: Storybook (optional)
- Internationalization: `vue-i18n` (optional)

# Frontend Development Guidelines (Vue)

Build on the stack above and follow these practices when authoring Vue applications.

## 1. Component Design

- Single responsibility: Components focus on UI fragments and interaction; business rules live in composables or the service layer.
- Composition API: Prefer `script setup`, `ref/reactive/computed`, and `watchEffect`; avoid overusing `watch`.
- Type safety: Use strict TS types for `defineProps`/`defineEmits`; follow the `update:modelValue` convention for events.
- Reusability: Extract common logic into `src/composables/` or `src/shared/`; avoid implicit coupling across components.
- Side-effect-free rendering: Do not start network requests inside `setup`; trigger side effects via explicit lifecycle hooks or user actions.

## 2. State Management

- Pinia first: Use Pinia for app-wide shared state; keep local UI state inside components.
- Persistence policy: Persist only necessary state (e.g., auth info, user preferences); avoid persisting derivable data.
- Derivations and selectors: Use `computed`/getters for derived state to reduce duplication.

## 3. Routing and Pages

- Chunking and lazy loading: Apply route-level lazy loading with named chunks; preload critical first-screen pages when justified.
- Guards and authorization: Centralize route guards for authentication and role access; align with the backend permission model.
- Accessibility: Manage focus and scroll behavior on navigation to enhance a11y.

## 4. Styling and Theming

- Design tokens: Unify colors, spacing, and typography via CSS variables; keep the component library theme aligned with the Tailwind config.
- Scope strategy: Prefer `scoped` styles or CSS Modules for local styles; centralize global styles in `src/styles/`.
- Icons and assets: Use on-demand and lazy loading to prevent bundle bloat.

## 5. HTTP and API Collaboration

- Axios instance: Centralize `baseURL`, `timeout`, and `headers`; use interceptors for auth (JWT/Bearer), error handling, and retries.
- OpenAPI contract: Backend publishes OpenAPI; frontend uses `openapi-typescript` to generate typed clients or definitions.
- Error model: Agree on error codes and structure (`code`, `message`, `details`); implement unified fallback messages and logging.
- Cancellation and concurrency: Cancel rapid successive requests and debounce; use abort signals (e.g., `AbortController`).

## 6. Performance and Usability

- Rendering optimization: Avoid synchronous rendering of large lists; use virtualized lists, pagination, or segmented rendering.
- Computation and caching: Reuse `computed` results; throttle/debounce expensive computations.
- Asset optimization: Lazy-load images, prefer SVG, split bundles and prefetch; use bundle analysis tools (e.g., `rollup-plugin-visualizer` or Vite analyzer).
- Accessibility (a11y): Follow ARIA guidelines; ensure keyboard navigability and readability.

## 7. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: Use Vitest; prioritize composables and pure functions.
- Component tests: Use Vue Test Utils; cover critical interactions and render paths.
- End-to-end: Use Playwright or Cypress; cover key user journeys and authentication flows.
- Coverage targets: Frontend overall 80%+, critical modules 90%+.

# Component Libraries Guidelines

Choose and use a single primary UI library per project to maintain consistent visuals and interactions.

- Selection criteria:
  - Element Plus: Enterprise admin, table/form-heavy scenarios, stability first.
  - Naive UI: Modern look, flexible customization, lighter weight.
  - Ant Design Vue: Comprehensive form system, unified design language.
  - Vuetify: Material Design alignment and consistency requirements.
- On-demand import: Enable on-demand loading and tree-shaking; align theme and interaction feedback (loading, message, modal).
- Form standards: Componentize form items, centralize validation rules, standardize error messages.

# Frontend-Backend Integration

These practices align Vue frontend apps with the FastAPI backend defined earlier.

- API versioning: Use URL prefixes or headers; maintain backward compatibility.
- Authentication and security: JWT (Authorization: Bearer), OAuth2; cookie sessions require CSRF protection; apply CSP, SRI, and input validation.
- CORS: Backend explicitly allows origins, methods, and headers; frontend sends credentials only when necessary.
- Logging and tracing: Use a unified `request-id`/`correlation-id` for end-to-end diagnostics.
- Types and code generation: OpenAPI → `openapi-typescript` for types; optionally use `orval` or `swagger-typescript-api` for client generation.

# Python Development Optimizations

These additions extend the earlier Python guidelines with practical tooling and structure choices.

- Static type checking: Add `mypy` in addition to Ruff (optional in CI) to enforce type consistency.
- Project structure: Use a `src/` layout; manage tool configurations centrally in `pyproject.toml` (ruff, pytest, mypy).
- Configuration management: Use `pydantic-settings` or `dynaconf` for env and configuration; separate `dev/staging/prod`.
- Async best practices: Prefer `async`/`await`; ensure compatibility with FastAPI/AnyIO; avoid blocking I/O.
- Testing pyramid: Emphasize unit tests with integration tests as needed; leverage `pytest` fixtures; aim for 90%+ coverage.
- Logging and observability: Use standard `logging` with structured JSON logs; inject request-level trace IDs; integrate OpenTelemetry where beneficial.
- Security: Validate parameters and inputs; perform dependency security scans (`pip-audit` or scan after `poetry export`); be cautious with deserialization and file operations.

# Build & CI/CD

Ensure consistent checks across frontend and backend for reliable delivery.

- Node package management: Prefer `pnpm` for the frontend; lock versions and enable strict resolution.
- CI checks: Frontend (ESLint/Prettier/tests/build), Backend (Ruff/mypy/pytest); require passing checks on PRs.
- Environment layering: Multi-environment configuration and secret management (do not expose sensitive data in frontend bundles).
- Deployment: Backend via `uvicorn`/`gunicorn` with `nginx`/`caddy`; serve frontend static assets via CDN with caching strategies.
